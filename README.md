In order to setup a development environment you need to install
- Unity Hub

You can install 
1. *Visual Studio 2019 community edition* to have an easy intellisense, it comes with .NET and everything you need to code for Unity.

2. Alternatively you'd need to install manually:

- [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/)
